# Omni Interaction Behav

***Omni Interaction Behav*** 

[Quick Start](https://github.com/9Din/Omni-nteraction-Behav?tab=readme-ov-file#tips)

This script based on the Omniverse platform (door and lighting control extension) mainly revolves around the dynamic interaction of doors and lighting management in 3D scenes. Its functional features make it suitable for the following specific scenarios:

> 1. Architectural Visualization: Creating Day Night Cycles to Simulate Real Building Use
> 2. Virtual simulation and interaction: testing interaction logic, adjusting physical parameters
> 3. Film and television preview: Quickly set the scene atmosphere and preview animation effects


Core Takeaways

1. Naming Standardization: Enforce consistent USD prim naming conventions for doors/lights to ensure reliable parsing—critical for team collaboration.
2. Parameter Tuning: Adjust animation duration, frame rate, and interpolation methods to balance visual quality and performance across use cases.
3. Resource Governance: Prioritize state caching and proper resource cleanup to optimize USD scene interaction efficiency.
4. Extensibility: Leverage door_types mappings and custom animation methods to adapt the script to specialized door/light configurations.
